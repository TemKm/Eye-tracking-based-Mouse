### Introduce
---
This program is designed to enable hands-free interaction with the computer's user interface.
Using the built-in camera on your laptop or a webcam, it tracks the movement of your eyes.

The mouse cursor then moves automatically to follow your eye movements.

To perform a left click, simply wink your right eye once.
